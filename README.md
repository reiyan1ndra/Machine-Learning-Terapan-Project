*  Tema Proyek: Predictive Analysis in Solar Power Plants
## Project Domain
This project focuses on the management and optimization of solar power plants in India. The data used in this project was collected from two solar power plants over a 34-day period. There are two types of data collected: power generation data at the inverter level and sensor data at the plant level. Each inverter has multiple lines of solar panels connected to it, while the sensor data is collected from a single array of sensors optimally placed throughout the plant. By using the available data, this project aims to provide valuable insights to enhance the efficiency and performance of solar power plants through more accurate predictions, timely maintenance, and identification of equipment issues.

## Business Understanding
The production of energy from solar panels is greatly influenced by weather conditions such as sunlight, clouds, and rainfall. Predicting these weather fluctuations with high accuracy, especially for a few days ahead, is challenging. Each inverter has different efficiencies and performance characteristics. Understanding how changes in efficiency affect energy production predictions is a separate challenge. Therefore, it is important to seek robust evaluation methods for predictive models to enhance accurate energy production, ensuring that the models can handle unforeseen weather variations.

### Problem Statement
From the business perspective outlined above, we aim to address: 
*  Can we achieve precise predictions of energy production from solar panels over the next couple of days?
*  How do variations in inverter efficiencies impact the overall prediction of energy production?
  
### Goals
Our objectives are:
*  Accurately forecast energy production from solar panels by incorporating inverter power values, temperature readings, and irradiation data.
*  Implement robust evaluation methods to validate the accuracy and reliability of our predictive models across varying conditions.
  
### Solutions
To achieve these goals, we will:
*  Select appropriate machine learning prediction models, considering the dataset's characteristics and objectives.

These steps are designed to enhance our ability to forecast solar panel energy production effectively, accounting for the variability in inverter efficiencies and ensuring the reliability of our predictive models under diverse environmental conditions.

## Data Understanding
The dataset used for this project can be downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anikannal/solar-power-generation-data/data). This dataset contains 68,773 records and 9 variables. It consists of two datasets: *Plant_1_Generation_Data.csv* and *Plant_1_Weather_Sensor_Data.csv*. Each dataset contains similar variables, but with important differences: the first dataset (Plant_1_Generation_Data) includes power and yield values, while the second dataset (Plant_1_Weather_Sensor_Data) includes solar panel temperature and irradiance values. Below is a detailed explanation of each variable:
*   `DATE_TIME` : Date and time for each observation
*   `PLANT_ID`
*   `SOURCE_KEY`: Inverter ID
*   `DC_POWER`: Amount of DC power generated by the inverter (source_key) in this 15 minute interval. Units - kW.
*   `AC_POWER`: Amount of AC power generated by the inverter (source_key) in this 15 minute interval. Units - kW.
*   `DAILY_YIELD`:  a cumulative sum of power generated on that day, till that point in time.
*   `TOTAL_YIELD`:  total yield for the inverter till that point in time.
*   `AMBIENT_TEMPERATURE`: the ambient temperature at the plant.
*   `MODULE_TEMPERATURE`: There's a module (solar panel) attached to the sensor panel. This is the temperature reading for that module.
*   `IRRADIATION`: Amount of irradiation (W/m<sup>2</sup>) for the 15 minute interval.
